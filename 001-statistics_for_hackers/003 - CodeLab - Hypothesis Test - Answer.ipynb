    "1. Determine Null Hypothesis ($H_{0}$) and Alternative Hypothesis ($H_{1})$.\n",
    "2. Identify test statistics to assess Null hypothesis's truth.\n",
    "3. Compute $p$-value, which is the probability that a test statistics at least significant\n",
    "4. Compare $p$-value to an $\\alpha$. If $p \\leq \\alpha$ then null hypothesis will be accepted, else if $\\alpha < p$ then null hypothesis will be rejected and alternative hypothesis will be accepted.\n",
